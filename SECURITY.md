# Security Policy

## Security Model

Claude Hub is designed to be accessed exclusively through a [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com) mesh VPN:

- **No ports exposed to the internet** — only devices on your private Tailscale network can reach Claude Hub
- **HTTPS support** with TLS 1.2+ and modern cipher suites (ECDHE+AESGCM/CHACHA20) via Tailscale's Let's Encrypt certificates
- **No additional authentication** — Tailscale already authenticates every device on the network
- **Sessions run as your OS user** — same permissions as a local terminal session
- **Input validation** — special key whitelist, path traversal prevention on folder picker, paste size limits (10KB)

## What IS a Security Concern

Please report vulnerabilities related to:

- **Privilege escalation** — any way to execute commands outside the intended tmux session
- **Authentication bypass** — accessing sessions or APIs without being on the Tailscale network
- **Path traversal** — escaping the configured DEV_ROOT in the folder picker
- **Cross-site scripting (XSS)** — injection via session names, folder names, or API responses
- **Command injection** — via session names, API parameters, or user input
- **Information disclosure** — leaking sensitive data through API endpoints or error messages

## What is NOT a Security Concern for This Project

The following should be reported to the respective upstream projects:

- **Tailscale vulnerabilities** → [Tailscale Security](https://tailscale.com/security)
- **ttyd vulnerabilities** → [ttyd GitHub Issues](https://github.com/tsl0922/ttyd/issues)
- **tmux vulnerabilities** → [tmux GitHub Issues](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/issues)
